# E-Toll
Project Name: E-Toll – Smart Toll Payment System
Purpose : The purpose of the E-Toll system is to provide a smart, digital, and cashless way to pay road tolls in
Bangladesh. Instead of waiting in long queues for manual payment, drivers can pay tolls online
using the E-Toll web application. After successful payment, users will receive a QR code that can be
scanned at toll gates to automatically open the barrier and deduct the toll.
